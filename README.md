## TAL4Tennis: Temporal Action Localization in Tennis Videos Using State Space Models

This repository contains the code and resources for our paper: Link to be added soon

## Acknowledgement
The used model architecture is the [VideoMambaSuite](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/video-mamba-suite) for TAL, We thank the authors for their amazing efforts.

## Installation
* Follow [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md) for installing necessary dependencies and compiling the code.
## Data Preparation
### 1. Download InternVideo2 Features and Annotations


## Models pre-trained
You can find all the pre-trained models in the link down below : 
https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1FAqtTXz8872htZCWX8QADQhrvOeDOO3C
Please put those in the correct ckpt folder (ckpt_tennis or ckpt_thumos)

## Add on the original video-mamba

From the forked video-mamba-suite we added an implementation on a tennis dataset.
We also added video-visualisation, inference and statics to better understand the models used
